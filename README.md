======================

## Synopsis

This project is a work in progress, C# port of the Cyclone physics engine at https://github.com/idmillington/cyclone-physics

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project is a programming challenge that presented itself a few months ago. The challenge was to simulate a ball bouncing around a 2D environment. The environment is rectangle in shape and would contain other rectangle shape objects which the ball can bounce off. Using one of the many good game engines around, this is a relatively simple problem to solve.

This project is mainly for understanding the basics of physics engine development so I have chosen to use Unity for the rendering and scene management.
